## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="possum.jpg">

Hey y'all! I'm a 1st year graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. My advisor is Professor [Inigo Incer](https://iincer.github.io/). I'm interested in using formal methods and other mathematical tools for the design and verification of complex systems. 

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's in Mathematics from the Georgia Institute of Technology (go jackets!).
